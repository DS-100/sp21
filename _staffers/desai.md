Hi! I am Priyans. I am a junior from India studying Computer Science. I really enjoyed Data 100 when I took it. I enjoy teaching and have been heavily involved with teaching since my second semester at Cal. I also run an initiative for Freshmen (Bear Advising), check it out here: [bit.ly/bear-advising](https://bit.ly/bear-advising). Feel free to email me about anything and I hope you all have a great semester :)
