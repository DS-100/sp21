Hi everyone! I am Priyans. I am a junior studying CS and minoring in Data Science. This is my 4th time on 16B staff. I really enjoyed the car project, especially controls when I took the class. I am heavily involved with teaching through different clubs and courses at Berkeley. Hoping to make labs a great experience for you all!
