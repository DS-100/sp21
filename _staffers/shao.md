Hi everyone, my name is Paul. I'm a 4th-year senior studying EECS. This is my 3rd time TA'ing the course and 5th time working on the Data 100 course staff. Remote learning has been challenging for a lot of people in the past few months, and I just want to acknowledge your dedication and congratulate everyone on prevailing through the course load in 2020. I look forward to working with you and making the Data 100 experience this semester as smooth and as fun as possible!
