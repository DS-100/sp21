Hey guys, I’m Agnibho. I am a third year majoring in EECS and Math from Dallas, Texas. If I’m not found procrastinating on homework or making fun probability questions, I’m usually playing tennis or beating my friends in FIFA. Hit me up if you want to watch a Mavs game together or for just about anything!
