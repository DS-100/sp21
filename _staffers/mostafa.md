Hey there! I’m Rami and I’m a senior from Sacramento studying EECS. I love going out on photo shoots and I absolutely love anything related to dogs! DS 100 has been one of my favorite courses, and I’m very excited to get to teach it for a third time! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or any cute dog pics!
